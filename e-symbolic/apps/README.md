Applications
======
Icons that describe what an application is, for use in the Programs menu, window decorations, and the task list. 
These may or may not be generic depending on the application and its purpose. Applications which are to be 
considered part of the base desktop, such as the calculator or terminal, should use the generic icons specified 
in this specification, while more advanced applications such as web browsers and office applications should use 
branded icons which still give the user an idea of what function the application provides.
