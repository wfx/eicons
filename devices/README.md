Devices
======
Icons for hardware that is contained within or connected to the computing device. Naming for extended devices in 
this group, is of the form <primary function>-<manufacturer>-<model>. This allows ease of fallback to the primary 
function device name, or ones more targeted for a specific series of models from a manufacturer. For example, a 
theme author may want to provide icons for different phones. The specific model icons could be named 
“phone-samsung-t809”, “phone-motorola-rokr”, and “phone-motorola-pebl”. However, the theme must provide a phone 
icon in the theme's style, so that devices not matching these models, will still have an appropriate icon. An 
exception to this rule is that the “media” icons do not need to include manufacturer names, as they are generic 
items, and may be available from many manufacturers. As a result, for media, the specific icons are to 
differentiate between different specific types of media. For exmaple, an artist may wish to provide icons for 
BluRay, DVD, HD-DVD, CD-ROM, and variations thereof. The specific media type icons should be named in the form, 
<primary function>-<specific format>. Some examples are “media-optical”, “media-optical-bd” and 
“media-optical-dvd”.
